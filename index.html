      <h2>About Aditya L1</h2>
      <p>
        Aditya-L1 is the first space-based observatory-class Indian solar
        mission to study the Sun. The spacecraft is planned to be placed in a
        halo orbit around the Lagrangian point1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system,
        which is about 1.5 million km from the Earth. A satellite placed in the
        halo orbit around the L1 point has the major advantage of continuously
        viewing the Sun without any occultation/eclipse. This will provide a
        greater advantage of observing the solar activities continuously. The
        spacecraft will carry seven payloads to observe the photosphere,
        chromosphere, and the outermost layers of the Sun (the corona) using
        electromagnetic and particle detectors. Using the special vantage point
        of L1, four payloads will directly view the Sun and the remaining three
        payloads will carry out in-situ studies of particles and fields at the
        Lagrange point L1. The suit of Aditya L1 payloads are expected to
        provide most crucial information to understand the problems of coronal
        heating, Coronal Mass Ejection, pre-flare and flare activities, and
        their characteristics, dynamics of space weather, study of the
        propagation of particles, fields in the interplanetary medium, etc.

          ASPEX (Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment) & PAPA (Plasma Analyser
          Package for Aditya)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment and Plasma Analyser Package for
          Aditya payloads are designed to study the solar wind and energetic
          ions, as well as their energy distribution. ASPEX is developed at
          Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. <br />
          The ASPEX payload comprises 2 subsystems: SWIS and STEPS. <br />
          SWIS (Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer) is a low-energy spectrometer that
          is designed to measure the proton and alpha particles of the solar
          wind. <br />
          STEPS (Suprathermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer)is a
          high-energy spectrometer that is designed to measure high-energy ions
          of the solar wind. <br />
          <br />
          PAPA is developed at Space Physics Laboratory, Vikram Sarabhai Space
          Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. It is designed to understand solar winds
          and its composition and, do mass analysis of solar wind ions

        <h2>What is L1 ?</h2>

        <p>
          L1 is Lagrange point between the Earth and Sun. For a two-body
          gravitational system, the Lagrange Points are the positions in space
          where a small object tends to stay, if put there. These points in
          space for a two-body system such as Sun and Earth can be used by the
          spacecraft to remain at these positions with reduced fuel consumption.
          <br />
          Technically at Lagrange point, the gravitational pull of the two large
          bodies equals the necessary centripetal force required for a small
          object to move with them. For two-body gravitational systems, there
          are total five Lagrange points, denoted as L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. The
          Lagrange point L1 lies between Sun-Earth line. The distance of L1 from
          Earth is approximately 1% of the Earth-Sun distance.
